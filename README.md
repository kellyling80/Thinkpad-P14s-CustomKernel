# Thinkpad-P14s-CustomKernel
Custom Linux minimal kernel for Lenovo Thinkpad P14s (AMD) GEN-1

This is a custom minimal kernel specially compiled for the **Lenovo Thinkpad P14s AMD (Type 20Y1) ONLY**. 

~~DOES NOT RUN ON INTEL-based P14s - the Intel kernel modules have been removed~~

***Update*: Intel kernel modules are included in the latest custom kernel iterations** - however kernels are not tested on Intel-based Lenovo P14s or any other Intel-based laptops for that matter

Initial baseline of modules were determined using modprobed-db (AUR) https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Modprobed-db 
Look into the modprobed-db file here for the modules included in this kernel

The **config** file is also included here for reference
